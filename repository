You will have to edit /etc/pacman.conf and add the following information to it.

[archassault]
Server = http://repo.archassault.org/archassault/$repo/os/$arch

Afterwards, run the following sequence in a terminal. You have to be root for running these commands.

pacman-key -r CC1D2606
pacman-key --lsign CC1D2606
pacman -Sy --noconfirm archassault-keyring archassault-mirrorlist

EDIT: you can then add the following line to your /etc/pacman.conf and replace the above location for archassault.

Include = /etc/pacman.d/archassault-mirrorlist

archassault-mirrorlist will allow you to choose a mirror closer to your location.
